- inside the function: requirements before start
	- a file with the same name as the bamfile , and in the same location but with extension .sorted.bam.bai

	- it needs in line 338 the filename of the bamfile itself , so with the new implementation this filename was erased from the code , but it is actually needed afterwards. 
	- and all the input files of essential genes, protein names and the genes annotations gff3
